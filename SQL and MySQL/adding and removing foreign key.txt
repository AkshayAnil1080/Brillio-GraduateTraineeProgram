 CREATE TABLE addresses(
  id INT,
  house_number INT,
  city VARCHAR(20),
  postcode VARCHAR(7)
  );

CREATE TABLE people(
id INT,
first_name VARCHAR(20),
last_name VARCHAR(20),
address_id INT
);


 i want address_id in people to reference the id colm in address table

1. 1st have to made id in address table a OK
 ALTER TABLE addresses
 ADD PRIMARY KEY(id);
 
 
 DESCRIBE addresses; - now key type will show PRI for id column
 DESCRIBE people;
 

2. people -> addresses table => change in people table, so alter table people
 ALTER TABLE people
 ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PeopleAdrress   - give any name
 FOREIGN KEY (address_id) REFERENCES addresses(id);


DESCRIBE people; - now key type will show MUL for address_id



REMOVING FK
ALTER TABLE people
DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_peopleAdress



Syntax
i want address_id in people to reference the id colm in address table
i want cl1 in t1 to refernce the cl2 in t2
S1. cl2 must be PK.

S2.
 ALTER TABLE <t1>
 ADD CONSTRAINT <constraint_name>  - give any name
 FOREIGN KEY (<cl1>) REFERENCES <t2>(<c2>);
